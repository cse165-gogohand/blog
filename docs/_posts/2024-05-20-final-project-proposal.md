## LifeSaver Volcanic Rescue

**Team Members**: Kevin Kim, Jose Arreguin, Vincent Zhang, Yong Gyun Kim

### About Our Project

LifeSaver Volcanic Rescue provides preventative/rescue features that possibly
occurred during volcanic eruptions. Main features include air quality monitoring
with respiratory support devices, patient health questionnaire and triage,
emergency treatment for seizures, fluid resuscitation using Meta Quest 2 and the
LifeSaver backpack kit.

### Technical features in Our Project

- Selection: The LifeSaver prompts many information and forms in virtual space.
  Users can interact with the UI using isomorphic virtual hands.
- Manipulation: Direct manipulation such as press the virtual button and process
  the forms via hands.
- Wayfinding: when air quality is hazardous, the LifeSaver indicates the air
  quality and leads to the safe area via path highlights on the ground as an
  overlay with proper indicators.
- Travel: The LifeSaver provides teleport via hand gestures and world in
  miniature (tentative)
- System Control (e.g., menu): The LifeSaver has a holistic menu system to
  access all forms and features. The menu will be prompt in the system at a near
  fixed distance of the user so that user can find the menu and access it
  easily.
- Symbolic Input (e.g., text or number input) with at least 10 symbols: The
  LifeSaver will accept input via voice recognition if necessary. When the
  information requires accuracy such as number, there will be a keypad for the
  input.
- Multi-User: N/A
- Hand tracking: The LifeSaver uses hand tracking as a primary input device.
  System control and selection/manipulation will be articulated with virtual
  hands and any complicated action will be utilized with hand gesture/posture
  recognition.

### An overview of the creative aspects of your project

LifeSaver Volcanic Rescue focuses on emergent medical support in volcanic areas.
Our project aims to provide not only immediate health advisories but also
precautions for users in dangerous situations. While LifeSaver provides
questionnaires to identify the current status of patients, the device also
monitors surroundings for possible hazardous situations. Additionally, the
project emphasizes the importance of a fluent user experience, enabling users to
utilize the tool as a primary companion rather than a secondary toolkit. The
team will focus on easy-to-use and accessible user interaction in the XR
environment such as hand gesture tracking, voice recognition, and isomorphic
selection/manipulation.
