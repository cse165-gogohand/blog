Our team had an initial meeting right after completing the project 3. We
discussed each technical requirement and also selected user story,
**Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus**, by Team C# from DSGN 160 presentation.

The selected user story requires multiple aspects of technology which are
aligned with required technical features and skills based on final project
implementation rubrics. Our team will work mixed-reality application that
provides air quality monitoring and SCBA features based on surrounding
conditions in volcanic region.

Our team splits each technical features to make progress in this stage.

- Kevin, Jose: Wayfinding, Travel
- Vincent, Yong: Symbolic Input, System Control

We established GitHub repository and basic environmental setup with [Meta XR
All-in-One SDK][1].

interactable with hand tracking. AQI interface will be fixed in the headset
direction so that user can keep monitoring the air quality.
