#### Abstract

Emergent event like volcano irruption can cause difficulties on breathing. While using the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), it is challenging to understand the key environmental metrics in situ, on demand and in real-time. We propose an AR device for users to continuously monitor real-time status of air quality index on the spot. The system can visualize the air quality index based on the multiple sensors in the area and provides the information of sensors and help how use equip SCBA device.

User can see surrounding via passthrough screen and they can do what need to do. The device keeps updating the air quality. If the air quality index goes high, the indicator will issue alert message and help to equip the device. Also, the device will provide way finding as well. Also user can place and change the sensor location based on real world with AR anchor. Our solution is based on the life savers' user story (Jolie) that focuses on volcanic SCBA. As a long term effect, user group can benefit multiple aspects: emergency escaping from harmful air quality, being helped how to use SCBA to avoid various symptoms from airborne chemicals and oxygen deficiencies.
